Created by Brendan Micallef, Laith Noaman, Jonathon Noujaim, Jaspreet Panesar and Zenne Randerath


## Tasks

#### Sprint 1 (15/4 - 28/4)
- [x] static sun sphere point light
- [ ] camera (freecam) which can be moved freely around the environment
- [x] earth sphere which rotates at a fixed speed
- [ ] earth sphere orbits around the sun at fixed distance and speed
- [x] second sphere on top of base earth sphere with adjustable diameter to simulate ocean level

#### Sprint 2 (29/4 - 12/5)
- [ ] second camera (orbital) which orbits around the earth
- [ ] earth rotates at an axis tilt (23.4 degrees)
- [ ] procedurally generated terrain on earth surface
- [ ] ocean level dynamically moves up and down to hide and reveal terrain (high/low tide)
- [ ] starfield in the background

#### Sprint 3 (13/5 - 26/5)
- [ ] user interface for all adjustable properties
    - [ ] start page to change terrain generation properties
    - [ ] in game window to change time speed, distances, etc..
- [ ] procedurally placed forests over generated terrain.
- [ ] third camera (pov) which can be controlled using keyboard to move around on the earth

#### Possible Improvements (27/5 - final submission due date)
- [ ] clouds rotating over the earth
- [ ] moon orbiting the earth.
- [ ] ambient lighting around the earth for nicer night time display
- [ ] realistic textures for the sun, moon, clouds, ocean and terrain
- [ ] multiple terrain types (green, yellow, white ground)


### Due Dates
- Presentation: 3/6
- Submission: 15/6
